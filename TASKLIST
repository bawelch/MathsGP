---MAPPING
if no valid parent point but valid child point, place under child 
Smart point find (radiate out, prefer point based on parent/child position rules) - not perfect but mostly behaves

---UI
Start with source and target selection, confirmation then applies reset formatting
Check dblclick works [no, need to apply a "removed" link style]
Why don't some clicks register?
Different styles for options alrady lockedUpdate
If no further links on a click, re-open the source (in future add something else interesting to dead ends)
Currently its adding new text over on each click, mostly lines but occasional creates boldind, only add on full redraw
Need an indicator/glow on held nodes with nodes left to click and/or spine points 
Calculate and apply spine
Figure out how to detect links crossing

Have a little man on a library ladder drawing this on a blackboard

---GAMEPLAY
Track clicks/actions (Energy System)
Event triggered on completing spine (partial and full)
Add Game Loop (explore/expand spine/allspine/allanc/alldesc)
